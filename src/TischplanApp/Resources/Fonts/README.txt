FONTS SETUP
===========

This folder should contain the following font files:
- OpenSans-Regular.ttf
- OpenSans-Semibold.ttf

You can download these fonts from:
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans

Download the font family, extract the TTF files, and place them in this directory.

The build will work without these fonts, but custom font styles won't be applied.
System fonts will be used as fallback.
